# Aiven Labs

**Aiven Labs** is where our experimental, non-production code goes. Sample code, examples used in customer meetings, and at conferences. Weâ€™re not expecting outside contributions, but don't let that stop you from submitting suggestions for improvement! For freshness, we archive repositories in Aiven Labs after 6 months of non-human activity.

## Other Aiven GitHub Organisations

Looking for core Aiven stuff? Public repositories under the [main **Aiven** Organisation](https://github.com/aiven) include the Aiven Terraform Provider, the Kubernetes Operator, and the mirrors for PostgreSQL, Apache Cassandra, etc. 

[**Aiven Open**](https://github.com/Aiven-Open) is where all open source projects made and maintained by Aiven and the Aiven Open Source Program Office (OSPO) live. These projects are actively looking for external contributors (individuals, as well as organisations). And in some cases (like Karapace), the project might see contribution from our Product teams as well. This is where you'll find the Klaw project, the Prometheus-Exporter for OpenSearch, all our Kafka Connectors, and more.
